# evolution-platformer

A basic project I'm making to learn about genetic evolution.  
This project evolves some simple "players" controlled by neutral networks.
  
In the future, I will make everything a bit more customizable and hopefully improve the evolution.  
If anyone has any feedback on what I could do differently, feel free to submit an issue!
